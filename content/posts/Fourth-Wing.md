## Introduction to Violet Sorengail:

 We start out with our main character Violet Sorengail being portrayed as a weak character. From her build, to the silver streak in her hair (which apparently is considered weak, maybe a recessive gene?), to the fact that her sister is begging their mom to let her join the scribe quadrant so she doesn’t die; we’re constantly told that Violet is considered weak in this fantasy world.

## Joining the Riders Quadrant:

Violet is tasked to join the riders quadrant, like her brother and sister before her, and because her mother is a general, she fearfully joins. She thinks she’ll die because this whole time she’s been training to be a scribe. The riders quadrant is basically a hunger games/divergent/Hogwarts mash-up. We get all these kids kind of “factioned” off to join the riders quadrant who then fight to the death and complete all these trials while going to war college so one day they can hopefully bind a dragon.

## Dragons and the Vale:

The dragons have their own set of rules but basically they protect the “Vale” which is where dragons fly and where our kingdom of Navarre is. The dragons have to bind to a human for the human to get their “signet” or superpower. For all this training, we don’t really get any hints of our enemies throughout most of the book.

## War College and Quadrants:

Now, this war college is about a couple years and this is Violet's first year. Does that mean each book she’s competing in trials preparing for something? Hopefully not. We still don’t know anything about dragonkind safe for Violet's recitations when she’s trying to distract herself. We still haven’t seen any gryphons or those half dragons they’re throwing at us. We still don’t know any other quadrants but the scribe and riders. You’re telling me there are only two factions that exist and no one speaks about the others???

## Violet's Dragon Bond:

Now, Violet of course makes it through to bind to a dragon but oh no no, not just any dragon; the BIGGEST MOST FRIGHTENING dragon that has no personality or semblance of self. For all that talk about dragonkind having their rules, the dragons are kind of stupid. I’m not mad at her binding the biggest dragon, I’m mad how she bonded. This whole book we were reminded of Violet's weakness and how she herself doesn’t believe she got this far, even with all the training and exercising. I don’t like my main character feeling bad for herself.

## Violet's Character Development:

Now, I’m all for a success story of the meek girl turning badass… but this. I honestly loved Violet in the beginning. She was honest with herself and had a silent strength that I looked up to. Unfortunately, that all went south when 75% into the book, SHE STILL THINKS SHE’S WEAK. You’d think that making it through all that trauma and trials you’d get some confidence about yourself. NO.

## The Inconsistency in Binding:

And she bonded the dragon not because of her wits or speed BUT BECAUSE TWO OTHER CADETS DECIDE TO WANT TO KILL A DRAGON?? Why would they do that? AFTER ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BINDING AND THRESHING THOSE TWO DUDES THREW IT ALL AWAY TO KILL A DRAGON!???? WHY? To risk their chance or not binding?

## Conclusion:

Why go on and on about the importance of binding only to give Violet a dragon not because she bonded or the dragon picked her, but because she was nice and decided to protect the dragon the guys were trying to kill. I wanted her to get picked because of her strength not in spite of it.
