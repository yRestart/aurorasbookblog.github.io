      <description>Early Life and Identity Born as the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark, the noble Warden of the North, Jon Snow&amp;rsquo;s early life is marked by the stigma of being a &amp;ldquo;bastard.&amp;rdquo; Raised alongside his trueborn siblings at Winterfell, Jon grows up feeling like an outsider, despite his fatherâ€™s attempts to treat him equally.
