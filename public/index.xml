      <description>Introduction to Violet Sorengail: We start out with our main character Violet Sorengail being portrayed as a weak character. From her build, to the silver streak in her hair (which apparently is considered weak, maybe a recessive gene?), to the fact that her sister is begging their mom to let her join the scribe quadrant so she doesn’t die; we’re constantly told that Violet is considered weak in this fantasy world.</description>

      <description>Early Life and Identity Born as the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark, the noble Warden of the North, Jon Snow&amp;rsquo;s early life is marked by the stigma of being a &amp;ldquo;bastard.&amp;rdquo; Raised alongside his trueborn siblings at Winterfell, Jon grows up feeling like an outsider, despite his father’s attempts to treat him equally. This sense of not belonging shapes Jon&amp;rsquo;s character and drives many of his decisions throughout his life.</description>
